## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked.
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone.
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.
- 
## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (CSS Variables)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first design approach
- JavaScript for dynamic interactions
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for typography

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to:

- Use JavaScript for handling user interactions, specifically toggling visibility of elements.
- Implementing responsive design using media queries to adapt the layout for various screen sizes.
- Working with CSS custom properties to easily manage colors and spacing for a cleaner, maintainable style.
  
For example, hereâ€™s how I used JavaScript to toggle the display of answers:

```javascript
question.addEventListener("click", () => {
    const isOpen = answer.style.display === "block";

    // Hide all answers first
    document.querySelectorAll(".answer").forEach(ans => ans.style.display = "none");

    // Toggle current answer and icon
    if (!isOpen) {
        answer.style.display = "block";
        icon.src = "./assets/images/icon-minus.svg";
    }
});
```

### Continued development

For future projects, I want to explore:

- Enhancing accessibility by ensuring that interactive elements are focusable and keyboard navigable.
- Improving performance by utilizing more advanced JavaScript techniques like event delegation.
- Creating more interactive and dynamic user interfaces using vanilla JavaScript before jumping into frameworks like React.
